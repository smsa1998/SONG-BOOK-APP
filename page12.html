            But my Father has His eye upon the sparrow<br/>
            He will lead you bring you to the perfect way<br/>
            <h3>Walk with Jesus every day<br/>
            And He’s promised to guide you all the way<br/>
            Walk with Jesus straight and true and you’ll see<br/>
            Walk with Jesus and you’ll be free</h3>
            What you are at this moment has some bearing<br/>
            On the way you face your life in years to com<br/>
            If you’re wise you will spend your time preparing<br/>
            And stop living for the moment’s passing fun</p>
