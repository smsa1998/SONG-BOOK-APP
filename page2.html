    <h7>John Newton</h7>
    <p>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound<br/>
    That saved a wretch like me<br/>
    I once was lost, but now am found<br/>
    Was blind, but now I see<br/>
    ’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear<br/>
    And grace my fears relieved<br/>
    How precious did that grace appear<br/>
    The hour I first believed<br/>
    Thru’ many dangers, toils and snares<br/>
    I have already come<br/>
    ’Tis grace that brought me safe thus far<br/>
    And grace will lead me home<br/>
    When we’ve been there ten thousand years<br/>
    Bright shining as the sun<br/>
    We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise<br/>
    Than when we first begun</p>

   <p>Owhat a wonderful,wonderful day<br/>
    Day I will never forget<br/>
    After I wandered in darkness away<br/>

    O what a tender compassionate friend<br/>

    Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling<br/>
    He made all the darkness depart<br/>
    Yes, Heaven came down and glory filled my soul<br/>
    When at the cross my Saviour made me whole<br/>
    My sins were washed away<br/>
    And my night was turned to day<br/>
    Yes, Heaven came down and glory filled my soul</p>
