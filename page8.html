       <p>I love this family of God<br/>
        So closely knitted into one<br/>

        And I’m so glad to be a part of this great family<br/>
        So won’t you join this happy throng<br/>
        You’ll find it’s just where you belong<br/>
        The Spirit of the Lord is here<br/>

        In this great family</p>

        I came to the Lord from a world filled with sin<br/>

          I know that His future is open to me<br/>
          In a world filled with darkness I suddenly see<br/>
          The plan of the Lord for the nations oppressed<br/>
          A Spirit that burns in the blessed<br><br/>
          The sign that follow those that believe<br/>
          No longer mere words but now I achieve<br/>
          The breastplate of righteousness I will put on<br/>
          For rousing the heavens with song</p>
