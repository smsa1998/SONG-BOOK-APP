        <h2>241. A brand new man     (G)</h2>
        <h7>David Ingles
          (Romans 8 :37, II Corinthians 5: 17</h7>
       <p>I’m a new creation, I’m a brand new man<br/>
        Old things are passed away, I am born again<br/>
        More than a conqueror, that’s what I am<br/>
        I’m a new creation, I’m a brand new man</p>

        <h7>Composer unknown          (Psalm 48 : 14)</h7>
       <p>I’ll be guided by Thee, I’ll be guided by Thee<br/>

        <h2>243. I’d rather walk with Jesus     (F)</h2>
        <h7>Composer unknown</h7>
       <p>I’d rather walk with Jesus<br/>
        Than roam the paths of sin<br/>
        I’d rather have His friendship<br/>
        Than earth’s best honours win<br/>
        My one desire to please Him<br/>
        As daily ways we trod<br/>
        And so we’re walking onward, upward<br/>
        Bound for heaven and God</p>

        <h2>244. Since the fulness of his love came in     (Eb)</h2>
        <h7>Bentley D. Ackley and Eliza E. Hewitt</h7>
       <p>I can never tell how much I love Him<br/>
        I can never tell His love for me<br/>
        For it passeth human measure<br/>
        Like a deep unfathomed sea<br/>
        ’Tis redeeming love in Christ my Saviour<br/>
        In my soul the heavenly joys begin<br/>
        And I live for Jesus only<br/>
        Since the fullness of His love came in</p>

        He’s alive, He’s alive, He’s alive for evermore<br/>

       <p>He paid a debt He did not owe<br/>
        I owed a debt I could not pay<br/>
