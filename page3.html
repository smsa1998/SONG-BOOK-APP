            Hopeless and helpless, bound to their beds<br/>

            <h3></h3>Wilt thou be made whole, body, mind and soul<br/>
            Rise, take up thy bed and walk<br/>
            Rise, take up thy bed and walk<br/>

            Rise little damsel I say unto thee<br/>
            Up from your bed and from death be set free<br/>
            Out of defeat to victorious life<br/>
            Into sweet peace out of turmoil and strife<br/>
