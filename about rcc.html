      <h1>ABOUT REVIVAL CENTERS CHURCH-THE HOLY SPIRIT EXPERIENCE</h1>
      <h2>REVIVAL CENTRES CHURCH HISTORY</h2>
      <p>Our foundation is based on the events recorded in Acts 2 in the Bible, where the<br/>
         disciples of Jesus were filled with the Holy Spirit. This same experience, with the<br/>
         Bible sign of speaking in other tongues, is still how people join the church today.</p>
         <h4>"......and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak<br/>
            with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance – Acts 2:4"</h4>
            <p>Our founding pastor, the late Lloyd Longfield, was filled with the Holy Spirit in 1948.<br/>
                From these exciting beginnings, Revival Centres has grown into a world-wide<br/>
                fellowship of spirit-filled believers. Over the years we’ve been known as<br/>
                Revival Centres of Australia, Revival Centres International, and more recently<br/>
                Revival Centres Church. Importantly, an adherence to the Full Gospel message hasn’t changed!</p>

                <h2>THE HOLY SPIRIT EXPERIENCE</h2>

                <p>Having a personal relationship with God is the promise of the bible.<br/>
                In a Revival Centre you will meet normal people who have had an extraordinary experience.<br/>
                The new testament of the bible describes a church that changed the world, full of people who knew God.<br/>
                It talks about salvation as a foundational experience from an answering God.</p>

                <h4>"Do you want to receive the Holy Spirit NOW?"</h4>

                <p>Jesus didn’t die to bring us dead religion. He came to fulfil God’s plan, and pour<br/>
                    out the Promise. He didn’t rely on finding strong, smart, good people.<br/>
                    Instead He sent the Holy Spirit to change people. He called it being born again.<br/>
                    Afterwards, nothing would be the same again. Ever.</p>

                <h2>ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>
                <p>The Revival Centre youth group runs from early high school age, through to young adults.<br/>
                Youngies is a great opportunity to spend time with Spirit-filled people, who have the same Holy Spirit experience.<br><br/>
                 
                The Youngies run great activities most weekends. These activities focus on good,<br/>
                clean fun and encouragement from each other, and the Bible. Most Revival Centre locations have a Youngies group.<br/>
