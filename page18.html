        <h7>Walter Morrison</h7>
       <p>The Shepherd’s footsteps clearly trace the pain<br/>

        To find and save His lost and dying sheep<br/>
        The price He paid, the debt I owe, I can’t ignore<br/>

        And this will be the year I’ll seek to find a lamb<br/>
        And bring it safely to the Shepherd’s fold<br/>
        To You, my Saviour, I give all I have and am<br/>
        That I may save at least one from the cold<br/>
        The Shepherd’s footsteps, by Your Spirit, Lord I’ll<br/>
        see
        My own feet tread the glorious path of gold</p>
