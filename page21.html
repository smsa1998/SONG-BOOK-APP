           <p>Give ear to my words, O Lord<br/>
            Consider my meditation<br/>
            Hearken unto the voice of my cry<br/>

            My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning<br/>
            O Lord, in the morning<br/>
            Will I direct my prayer<br/>
            Unto Thee and will look up<br/>
            O Lord, in the morning</p>

           <p>God’s got an army marching through the land<br/>
            Deliverance is their song<br/>

            <h7>Barry McGuire & Tony Salerno</h7>
           <p><h3>We are the soldiers of the army of salvation<br/>
            That God is raising up to save the world<br/>
            And we won’t lay down our arms<br/>
            Until every nation<br/>
            Is bowed on bended knee before the Lord</h3>
            Though the hosts of hell and darkness<br/>
            Come head-on against us<br/>
            By suffering temptations we are tried<br/>
            And we know there’s not a power<br/>
            That can overcome us<br/>
            With the love of Jesus by our side<br><br/>
            So we’ll put our trust in Jesus<br/>
            He will never fail us<br/>
            We know that His salvation we shall see<br/>
            It’s a loving revelation<br/>
            Not a violent revolution<br/>
            For peace can only come through Calvary</p>
