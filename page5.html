        I will celebrate nativity<br/>
        For it has its place in history<br/>
        Sure He came to set His people free<br/>
        What is that to me<br/>
        Till one day I met Him face to face<br/>
        And I sought the wonder of His grace<br/>
        Then I knew that He was more than just a God<br/>
        who didn’t care<br/>
        That lived away up there, and<br/>
        Now He walks beside me day by day<br/>
        Ever watching o’er me lest I stray<br/>
        Helping me to find that narrow way<br/>
        He’s everything to me</p>
