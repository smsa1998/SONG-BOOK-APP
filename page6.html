            <h2>102.  The old, old story     (F)</h2>
            <h7>Composer unknown</h7>
           <p>The old, old story, it is ever new<br/>
            The old, old story, praise the Lord it’s true<br/>
            That Jesus died for me as well as you<br/>
            I love the old, old story<br/>
            When the roll is called up yonder<br/>
            I’ll be walking in the King’s highway<br/>
            Tell me the old, old story<br/>
            I love Him better every day, hallelujah<br/>
            “I will make you fishers of men if you’ll only<br/>
            follow me”<br/>
            Now none but Christ can satisfy<br/>
            And there’s no other name for me<br/>
            Because He’s mine, mine, mine mine, Jesus is mine<br/>
            Mine when I’m weary, mine when I’m cheery<br/>
            Mine, mine, mine, mine, Jesus is mine<br/>
            Jesus is always mine<br/>
            I talk about my Saviour everywhere I go<br/>
            Everywhere I go, yes everywhere I go<br/>
            And while I talk about Him<br/>
            The waves of glory roll<br/>
            Bringing joy to my soul<br/>
            Just a little longer<br/>
            And the trump of God shall sound<br/>
            Just a little longer and we’ll all be glory bound<br/>
            Look away to heaven<br/>
            Your redemption draweth nigh<br/>
            Just a little longer<br/>
            And we’ll meet Him in the sky<br/>
            When I remember what He’s done for me<br/>
            I’ll never go back anymore, anymore<br/>
            When I remember how He set me free<br/>
            I’ll never go back anymore<br/>
            No, no, no, no, no I’ll never go back any more,<br/>
            anymore<br/>
            When I remember how He set me free<br/>
            I’ll never go back anymore</p>
